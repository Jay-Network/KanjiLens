## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS (Save 5 min for Q&A)

**"Why so fast?"**
→ "Claude Code AI agents. My permanent edge over manual coding."

**"What if it doesn't sell?"**
→ "Worst case: Integrate into TutoringJay to attract students. Even 0.1% of 3M learners = $15K revenue."

**"What about iOS?"**
→ "Android first (70% market). Port to iOS in 2-3 hours once we hit $10K revenue."

**"What's stopping big players?"**
→ "Speed. We move in HOURS, they move in QUARTERS. By the time they react, we have 10K users and 500 reviews."

**"Why only $5K instead of $10K?"**
→ "Development costs dropped 90%. Lower risk for you, faster ROI."

## 🎤 CLOSING (2 minutes)

"Here's the reality:

✅ **Working app** - not a mockup (show Z Flip 7)
✅ **Proven speed** - 75 min, not 6 weeks
✅ **Built-in testers** - Boston J Lounge starts Feb 8
✅ **Launch ready** - App Store by Feb 22
✅ **20x ROI potential** - $5K → $102K over 5 years

Your $5,000 buys 15% of an app that's ALREADY WORKING and launches in 17 DAYS.

This isn't just a good app - it's proof that AI-powered development changes everything.
