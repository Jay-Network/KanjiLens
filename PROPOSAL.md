# KanjiLens Investment Proposal

**To**: Hayato Kawai
**From**: Jay (JWorks)
**Date**: February 5, 2026
**Subject**: Investment Opportunity - KanjiLens Japanese Reading App

---

## Summary

I'm inviting you to invest **$5,000 for 15% equity** in KanjiLens, a camera-based Japanese reading assistant app that I've built and tested today.

**What makes this different**: I built a working, tested prototype in 3 hours using AI-assisted development. This isn't a pitch deck for an idea - it's a **working product ready for beta testing**.

---

## What I've Built (Today)

**Working Features**:
- ✅ Real-time camera OCR for Japanese text
- ✅ Context-aware furigana readings above kanji
- ✅ Intelligent kanji-only rendering (hides hiragana you can already read)
- ✅ Professional settings UI (customizable colors, text size, opacity)
- ✅ Fully tested on Samsung Z Flip 7

**Development Time**: ~3 hours (original estimate: 4-6 weeks)

**I can show you the working app right now on my phone.**

---

## The Opportunity

### Market Problem
- 3-5 million Japanese learners worldwide struggle to read kanji
- 100,000+ heritage speakers (Japanese-Americans) can speak but can't read
- Current apps have terrible ratings (2.5★) and charge $12.99/month

### Our Solution
- **Better product**: Context-aware furigana (knows 生 = なま in 生ビール, せい in 学生)
- **Better UX**: Clean, modern interface that only shows what you need
- **Better price**: $4.99 one-time OR $1.99/month (60% cheaper than competitors)
- **Better tech**: Built with AI agents - we iterate 60x faster than traditional dev teams

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Year | Users | Revenue | Your 15% Share |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Year 1 | 1,500 | $7,000 | $1,050 |
| Year 2 | 5,000 | $25,000 | $3,750 |
| Year 3 | 12,000 | $75,000 | $11,250 |
| Year 4 | 25,000 | $175,000 | $26,250 |
| Year 5 | 50,000 | $400,000 | $60,000 |

**5-Year Total Return**: $102,300 on $5,000 investment (**20x ROI**)

## Your Built-In Distribution Advantage

You already help me run **Boston J Lounge** - weekly events with 20-30 Americans studying Japanese.

**But there's more**: I just accepted a Vice President role at Mr. Takinami's Boston local publishing company (he's my boss at Boston Kanko tourism company). This gives us a **triple distribution channel**:

### 1. Boston J Lounge
- 20-30 weekly attendees studying Japanese
- Direct beta testing community
- Word-of-mouth marketing

### 2. Boston Japanese Publishing Network 🆕
- **Mr. Takinami's comprehensive Japanese network** in Boston
- **Free advertising**: I'm building the bulletin board website for his publishing company - can promote KanjiLens there
- **Established credibility**: Publishing company endorsement = instant trust with Japanese community
- **Access to Japanese-American market**: The exact target demographic for KanjiLens

### 3. Boston Kanko Tourism Company 🆕
- Japanese travelers to Boston = perfect users (need reading assistance)
- Can promote app to tourism clients
- Real-world use case: "Download KanjiLens before visiting Boston"

**Beta Testing Plan**:
1. **Week 1-2**: I finish polish & testing
2. **Week 3**: Launch beta at Boston J Lounge event (Feb 15 or 22)
3. **Week 3**: Announce on publishing company bulletin board
4. **Week 4**: Gather feedback, fix bugs, get testimonials
5. **Week 5**: Public launch on Google Play Store

**This gives us**:
- 20-30 real beta testers immediately (Boston J Lounge)
- Access to established Japanese network (Publishing company)
- Tourism company client base (Japanese travelers)
- Multiple testimonial sources
- Word-of-mouth marketing across three communities
- Validation before public launch

### 1. Triple Distribution Channel

- **Not a solo founder** = backed by established Japanese business network in Boston

### 3. AI-Powered Development Speed
- Build features in hours, not weeks

- Respond to user feedback same-day
- Competitors can't keep up

### 3. Better Product Than Competitors
- **Accuracy**: Context-aware furigana (industry-leading)
- **UX**: Clean, modern, kanji-only rendering
- **Price**: $4.99 vs $12.99/mo (60% cheaper)

## Competitive Analysis

| App | Price | Rating | Our Advantage |
|-----|-------|--------|---------------|
| Furigana Camera | $12.99/mo | ⭐⭐ (2.5★) | Better UX, 60% cheaper |
| Yomiwa | $5 one-time | ⭐⭐⭐ | Context-aware accuracy |
| Dokuen | Free | ⭐⭐⭐ | Better tech, no accessibility hacks |

**Market gap**: No app combines real-time accuracy + clean UX + fair pricing. We fill that gap.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### "What if it doesn't sell?"
**Worst case**: Integrate into TutoringJay for free, use to attract tutoring students. Even without app revenue, it pays for itself in student acquisition.

### "What if development takes longer?"
**Proof**: I built Phase 1-2 in 3 hours (estimated 4-6 weeks). We ship fast.

### "What about iOS?"
**Plan**: Android first (70% of global market). Port to iOS in 2-3 hours once we hit $10K revenue. Then we double our market.

### "What's stopping Google/Duolingo from copying?"
**Speed**: By the time they decide, get budget, hire devs, and ship... we'll have 10K users and 500 reviews. We move in HOURS, they move in QUARTERS.

## Demo Instructions

I have the working app on my Samsung Z Flip 7 right now.

**To see it in action**:
1. Pull out any Japanese text (book, menu, sign, phone screen)
2. I'll point my camera at it
3. You'll see furigana readings appear above kanji in real-time

**What you'll see**:
- Small white pills with hiragana readings above kanji characters
- Colored boxes around kanji (customizable in settings)
- Hiragana/katakana you can already read stays hidden (clean UI)

**This is real, working software - not a mockup.**

---

## Next Steps

### If You're In:
1. **Today**: Verbal agreement
2. **By Feb 7**: I draft investment agreement
3. **Feb 8**: You wire $5,000 to JWorks business account
4. **Feb 9-11**: I finish Phase 3-4
5. **Feb 15**: Beta launch at Boston J Lounge
6. **Mar 4**: Public App Store launch
7. **Mar 8+**: Revenue starts flowing

### If You Need Time:
- **Give me 7 days**: Beta test the app yourself for a week, then decide
- **Ask questions**: I'm happy to explain any part in more detail
- **Try Option B or C**: Lower risk options if $5K feels high

### Decision Timeline
I need an answer by **February 7** to hit our March 4 App Store launch date.

The app exists. The market exists. The distribution exists. The only question is: **Do you want to be part of it?**
